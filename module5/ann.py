        The method blind test must accept a list of sublists, where each sublist is a vector of length 784 corresponding
        to the raw features of one image: each sublist is a flattened image containing integers in the range [0, 255].
        These raw features come directly from a flat-case file. The list does NOT contain labels, hence the adjective
        blind. Your method must produce a flat list of labels predicted by the ann when given each feature vector as
        input. Items in the labels list must correspond to items in the flattened image list. So if feature sets
        consists of five image vectors, a 7, two 3â€™s, an 8 and a 2 (in that order), then if your ann classifies them
        correctly, it should return this:

        [7,3,3,8,2]
